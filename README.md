# Database&MLmodel_prep_Montney
In this project, we compiled a database according to independent variables that have the strongest correlation with gas production rate in a typical unconventional reservoir, the Montney formation in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Using this database, the performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) with 11 different training algorithms (12 models) were evaluated to determine the best method to model the average gas production rate over the first year of operation (which is called the average gas production rate in this paper). The benchmarks to compare the algorithms were the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R2), mean relative error (MRE), and execution/computational time.
