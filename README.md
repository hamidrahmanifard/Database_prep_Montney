# Database_prep_Montney
In this project, I compiled a database according to all available field data independent variables that have the strongest correlation with gas production rate in a typical unconventional reservoir, the Montney formation in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Using this database, in the next project, I am trying to assess the performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) with different training algorithms to determine the best method to model the average gas production rate over the first year of operation.
